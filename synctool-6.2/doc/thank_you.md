7. Thank you
============
A big thanks goes out to all synctool users. You know who you are (!)
Special thanks go to those whom I've had e-mail conversations with about
synctool, and those at [github][1] who have made good suggestions for
improving synctool.
And last but not least, very special thanks go to those who contributed to
synctool in one way or another. synctool would not be what it is today
without your contributions.

If you also want to contribute to synctool, drop me an e-mail. If you are a
programmer who likes to contribute to the development of synctool, please
fork the [github project][1] and issue pull requests. If you don't know how
`git` works, patches in `diff -u` format are always welcome too. However,
I highly recommend `git` and [github][1].
