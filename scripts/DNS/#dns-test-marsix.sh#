# test that verify that the system meets the following criteria

5-1 Install a DNS server on your server and configure it to meet the
following requirements.

a) It must respond authoritatively to all non-recursive queries for
names in the zones you are authoritative for.

b) It must respond to all recursive queries from the hosts on your own
network.

c) It must not respond to any recursive queries from any outside host
(i.e. host not on your own network).

d) Apart from the queries in (a), it should not respond to any queries
from any outside host.

e) It must contain valid zone data for your zone(s).

f) The cache parameters must be chosen sensibly (i.e. you are expected
to be able to motivate your choice).

g) It must not be susceptible to the standard cache poisoning
attacks. See http:www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/800113 for details. Test
your DNS server using porttest.dns-oarc.net (see
http:www.dns-oarc.net/oarc/services/porttest).

5-2 Install zone data for your normal zone.
