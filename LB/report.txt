a) Which are the nine sections of the Unix manual.

       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions eg /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]


b) Which section of the manual contains user commands such as cat and ls.

	Executable programs or shell commands

c) Which section documents file formats, such as configuration files.

	File formats and conventions eg /etc/passwd

d) Which section contains system administration commands, such as halt.

	System administration commands (usually only for root)



4-1 The SYNOPSIS section briefly lists how a command is invoked. Read the man page for man and explain what the following command synopsis texts mean. Explain how each command may or must be invoked; you don't need to know what the commands actually do.

a) mkpasswd PASSWORD SALT

	Replace PASSWORD and SALT with appropriate arguments.

b) uniq [OPTION]... [INPUT [OUTPUT]]

	Optionally replace [OPTION] with an option, it is also repeatable, specified by ...
	OUTPUT is also optional, but only given an input, which is also optional.

c) gzip [-acdfhlLnNrtvV19 ] [-S suffix] [ name ... ]

	Any or all arguments in [-acdfhlLnNrtvV19 ] are optional. -S suffix is optional with suffix replaced by an 		argument. Name is an optional repeatable argument. 

d) chcon [OPTION]... CONTEXT FILE...

	Option denotes repeatable options, context is to be replaced with an appropiate argument, so is file and 	file is repeatable. You need atleast one file and you need exactly one context. 

chcon [OPTION]... [-u USER] [-r ROLE] FILE...

	A list of options, an optional user, an optional role and then atleast one file. 

chcon [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...

	A list of options, a reference RFILE and a list of files, atleast one. 
13-1 What do the following commands do? If you want to test your theories, use /data/kurs/TDDI41/bin/stdio for command and grep for "E" rather than "fail".

a) ls | grep -i doc b) command 2>&1 | grep -i fail c) command 2>&1 >/dev/null | grep -i fail 13-2 Write command lines to perform the following tasks.

a) Output a recursive listing (using ls) of your home directory, including invisible files, to the file /tmp/HOMEFILES.

b) Find any files (using find) on the system that are world-writable (i.e. the write permission for "others" is set). Error messages should be discarded (redirected to /dev/null). This command is actually useful for auditing the security of a system - world-writable files can be security risks.
4-2 Read the man page for man, as well as some other man pages (e.g. for ls, uniq, chmod, and adduser) and answer the following questions.

a) What do you usually find in the DESCRIPTION section.

	What the program does, how to do it, and a list of options. 

b) Which section(s) usually document, in detail, what each command-line option does.

	Descriptions unless the options are intricate, then it's options. 

c) Let's say you're reading the man page for a command and the information you are looking for isn't there. In which part can you find references to other man pages that might contain what you are looking for (have a look at the man page for reboot, imagining that you are trying to find a command that will turn the computer off, for an example).

	"SEE ALSO"

d) In which section do you find information about which configuration files a program uses?

	"FILES"

4-3 Use the man page for man to answer the following questions.

a) Sometimes there are several man pqages (located in different sections) for the same keyword. Which command-line option to man can you use to display all of them.

	man -a ARGUMENT

b) Sometimes you don't know the name of a command you are looking for, but can guess at a keyword related to the command. Which command-line option can you use to have man list all pages related to a specific keyword.
	
	man -k KEYWORD

4-4 Display the man page for the ls command.

a) What does the ls command do.

	Lists files and directores in a directory alphabetically. 

b) What option to ls shows information about file sizes, owner, group, permissions and so forth.

	-l

c) What does the -R option to ls do? (Don't forget to try it.)

	list subdirectories recursively

5-1 In the example above name at least one relative path name indicating ssh if a) The current working directory is /usr/bin.

	ssh

b) The current working directory is /usr/local/bin.

	../../bin/ssh 

6-1 It is possible to set individual permissions for user, group and others using chmod. Review the documentation and answer the following questions.

a) How can you set the permission string to user read/write, group read, others read using chmod in long format.

	chmod -rw-r--r-- FILE

b) How can you revoke group write permissions on a file without changing any other permissions.

	chmod g-r FILE

c) How can you grant user and group execute permissions without changing any other permissions.

	chmod ug+x FILE

7-1 What do the following numeric file modes represent.

a) 666 
	rw-rw-rw-

b) 770 
	rwxrwx---

c) 640 
	rw-r-----
d) 444
	r--r--r--
	

7-2 What command-line argument to chmod allows you to alter the permissions of an entire directory tree.

	-R

7-3 What does execute (x) permission mean on directories.

	search

7-4 A user wants to set the permissions of a directory tree rooted in dir so that the user and group can list, read and write (but not execute) files, but nobody else has any access. Which of the following commands is most appropriate? Why.

a) chmod -R 660 dir

	this

b) chmod -R 770 dir

c) chmod -R u+rw,g+rw,o-rwx dir

When answering this question, consider how the execute permission is handled by the various choices, and what importance the execute permission has on directories.
13-1 What do the following commands do? If you want to test your theories, use /data/kurs/TDDI41/bin/stdio for command and grep for "E" rather than "fail".

a) ls | grep -i doc b) command 2>&1 | grep -i fail c) command 2>&1 >/dev/null | grep -i fail 13-2 Write command lines to perform the following tasks.

a) Output a recursive listing (using ls) of your home directory, including invisible files, to the file /tmp/HOMEFILES.

b) Find any files (using find) on the system that are world-writable (i.e. the write permission for "others" is set). Error messages should be discarded (redirected to /dev/null). This command is actually useful for auditing the security of a system - world-writable files can be security risks.
8-1 How can you change the owner and group of an entire directory tree (a directory, its subdirectories and all the files they contain) with a single command.

	chown -R user:group DIR

9-1 What does cd .. do.

	Goes up a directory.

9-2 What does cd ../.. do.

	Goes up two directories.

9-3 What information about a file is shown by ls -laF?

	ACL, number of files pointing to that particular inode, owner, group owner, file size, date last modified,
	filename. F appends indicators to entries. * for executables, / for directores, @ for sumbolic links, | for
	FIFOs, = for sockets, > for doors, and nothing for regular files. 

9-4 In the following output from -...- Explain the following.

a) What does the "c" at the beginning of the second line mean.

	It means dsp is a character special file.

b) What do "dave" and "staff" mean on the first line, and "root" and "audio" on the second.

	dave is the owning user, staff is the owning group. root is the owning user, audio is the owning group. 

c) Which users may write to the file dsp.

	root and anyone in the audio group. 

9-5 If you have two files, a and b, and you issue the command mv a b, what happens? Is there an option to mv that will issue a warning in this situation.

	a will overwrite b. -i will prompt before overwrite. 

9-6 What option(s) to cp allows you to copy the contents of /dir1 to /dir2, preserving modification times, ownership and permissions of all files.

	cp -p /dir1 /dir2

9-7 How do you make the file secret readable and writable by root, readable by the group wheel and completely inaccessible to everybody else.

	chmod 040 secret

10-2 What init files does your shell use, and when are they used? (Hint: your shell has a man page, and somewhere near the end there is a section that lists which files it uses).

       /etc/profile
              The systemwide initialization file, executed for login shells
       /etc/bash.bashrc
              The systemwide per-interactive-shell startup file
       /etc/bash.bash.logout
              The systemwide login shell cleanup file, executed when a login shell exits
       ~/.bash_profile
              The personal initialization file, executed for login shells
       ~/.bashrc
              The individual per-interactive-shell startup file
       ~/.bash_logout
              The individual login shell cleanup file, executed when a login shell exits
       ~/.inputrc
              Individual readline initialization file
13-1 What do the following commands do? If you want to test your theories, use /data/kurs/TDDI41/bin/stdio for command and grep for "E" rather than "fail".

a) ls | grep -i doc b) command 2>&1 | grep -i fail c) command 2>&1 >/dev/null | grep -i fail 13-2 Write command lines to perform the following tasks.

a) Output a recursive listing (using ls) of your home directory, including invisible files, to the file /tmp/HOMEFILES.

b) Find any files (using find) on the system that are world-writable (i.e. the write permission for "others" is set). Error messages should be discarded (redirected to /dev/null). This command is actually useful for auditing the security of a system - world-writable files can be security risks.
11-1 Use the env command to display all environment variables. What is PATH set to (you might want to use grep to find it)? What is this variable used for (the man pages for your shell might be helpful in answering this question).

	PATH=/home/TDIU16/lab/bin:/sw/gcc-3.3.6/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/sw/local/bin:/usr/games:.
	Path is the search path for commands. So you can run the executables from directories specified by :
	without typing in the search path.

11-2 Use echo to display the value of HOME. What does the HOME variable normally contain.
	
	Path to the home folder. 

11-3 Prepend /data/kurs/adit/bin:/data/kurs/TDDI41/bin to the variable PATH. The easiest way to accomplish this is to use variable expansion in the right-hand side of the assignment.
q
	PATH=/data/kurs/adit/bin:/data/kurs/TDDI41/bin$PATH

13-1 What do the following commands do? If you want to test your theories, use /data/kurs/TDDI41/bin/stdio for command and grep for "E" rather than "fail".

a) ls | grep -i doc 

	Lists all files following the pattern doc, case insensitive. 

b) command 2>&1 | grep -i fail
	
	The output from command to standard error is sent to a copy of standard out. All these including fail (not
	case sensitive) will be listed by grep. 

c) command 2>&1 >/dev/null | grep -i fail 

	Redirects the std err from command to stdout, and then stdout to /dev/null (without changing our stderr 
	redirect). grep for rows containing fail despite upper lower case. 


13-2 Write command lines to perform the following tasks.

a) Output a recursive listing (using ls) of your home directory, including invisible files, to the file /tmp/HOMEFILES.

	ls -aR ~ > /tmp/HOMEFILES


b) Find any files (using find) on the system that are world-writable (i.e. the write permission for "others" is set). Error messages should be discarded (redirected to /dev/null). This command is actually useful for auditing the security of a system - world-writable files can be security risks.
	
	find / -perm /o+w -type f

14-1 Create a long running process by typing ping 127.0.0.1. Suspend it with vZ and bring it to the foreground with fg. Terminate it with vC.

	ping 127.0.0.1
	ctrl z
	fg
	ctrl c

14-2 Create a long running process in the background by typing ping 127.0.0.1 >/dev/null&. Find out its process id using ps and kill it using kill.

	ping 127.0.0.1
	ps
	kill 9371

14-3 What does the command kill -9 pid do, where pid is the number of a process? What does kill -9 -1 do? Read the documentation to figure the last one out as it is a somewhat dangerous command.

	kill -9	pid		-9 kills the process without allowing it to finish. 
	kill -9 -1		Kill all processes you can kill.

	

14-4 Create a long running process in the background by typing ping 127.0.0.1 >/dev/null&. Kill it using pkill. The pkill command is very useful when you need to kill several processes that share some attribute (such as a command name).

	ping 127.0.0.1 >/dev/null&
	pkill ping


16-1 What keystroke in less moves to the beginning of the file.

	HOME

16-2 What keystroke in less moves to the end of the file.

	END

16-3 What would you type in less to start searching for "option".

	/option

16-4 What would you type in less to move to the next match for "option".

a) What is the default setting for ForwardX11.

	It's activated. 	

b) If you want X11 forwarding to work, what other package(s) need to be installed on the server.

	xauth 

18-1 What does tail -f /var/log/syslog do.

	outputs the 10 last lines of syslog

18-2 If you want to extract the last ten lines in /var/log/syslog that are related to the service cron, what command would you use? (Hint: the grep command can search for matching lines in a file).

	cat /var/log/syslog | grep cron | tail

19-1 What services are started when your system boots into run level 2 (i.e. not only services exclusive to run level 2, but all services started as the computer boots into run level 2).
