1-1 Review the documentation for the ping utility and answer the following questions.

a) What is the ping utility used for.

	To figure out wether or not you can communicate with a machine on an IP adress, and the roundtrip time of
	that signal. 

b) What command-line option to ping causes it to print numerical addresses.

	-n

c) How does the ping utility work.

	ping uses the ICMP protocol's mandatory ECHO_REQUEST datagram to elicit an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host
	or gateway. 

d) How can you detect if the host 10.17.1.1 is up.

	try using ping 10.17.1.1
	if it's down we shouldn't get 100% packet loss. 

1-2 Review the documentation for the traceroute utility and answer the following questions.

a) What is the traceroute utility used for.

	tracks the route packets take to a given host. 

b) How does traceroute work.

	We send packets with TTL 1, then 2, etc, until we actually reach the host. The nodes that send a packet
	saying our TTL expired will lead up the host.

c) What command-line option causes traceroute to print numerical addresses.

	It already does. 

d) Use traceroute with a remote host of your choosing as the target. Explain all the output.

	Every line of output is a node that needs to be traversed in order to reach the remote host. The first
	column is hostname, the second is adress. The three times represent three packets, three packets per TTL is 
	sent and the times are roundtrip times for those three packets. * indicates a drop (and thus * * * indicates
	three drops). 

1-3 Review the documentation for the ifconfig, route, netstat and ip commands and answer the following questions.

a) How do you set the address of interface eth0 to 130.236.189.14/24 (netmask 255.255.255.0) and broadcast address 130.236.189.255 using ifconfig? How do you set it using ip.

	ifconfig eth0 adress 130.236.189.14
	ifconfig eth0 broadcast 130.236.189.255
	ifconfig eth0 netmask 255.255.255.0


	ip adress add 130.236.189.14/24 dev eth0

b) How do you display the current routing table using route? How do you display it using ip? Using netstat.

	route
	ip route
	netstat -r

1-4 Review the documentation for the sysctl command and answer the following.

a) What is a sysctl (not what does the command do, but what a sysctl actually is).

	sysctl is an interface for examining and dynamically changing parameters in Unix-like operating systems.

b) In what file can you place sysctl values so they are loaded at boot time.

	/etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf (or another applicable parameter file in that directory)

c) Which sysctl controls IP forwarding.

	net.ipv4.ip_forward

1-5 Which addresses are your hosts supposed to use? Which names? Which netmasks and broadcast addresses? You can find this information on the course home page.

1-6 Explain the difference between routing and forwarding (as related to IP networking).

	Routing is selecting what node to send packets to, forwarding is recieving packets and sending them out. 

7-1 Answer the following questions.

a) What configuration file controls NSS.

	/etc/nsswitch.conf

b) What configuration file controls the resolver.

	/etc/resolv.conf

c) What does the "search" keyword in the resolver configuration file do.

	It means if we were to try an incomplete host, the domains listed in the search field will be tacked on one
	by one and the first one that result in a match will be used, in our case ida.liu.se will be used. 


8-1 Quagga consists of several separate processes. Describe how they fit together.
	
	bgpd supports the BGP-4 protocol. 
	ripd handles the RIP protocol. 
	ospfd supports OSPF v2 protocol. 
	zebra acts as API to the kernel routing table. 

8-2 What configuration files does the Debian installation of Quagga use.

	/etc/quagga/debian.conf
	/etc/quagga/daemons
	/etc/quagga/ripd.conf
	/etc/quagga/zebra.conf

8-3 How do you configure Quagga interactively? When configuring interactively, how do you save the current configuration to file.

	write file 

9-1 Explain, in broad terms, how RIP works.

	RIP employs a hop count metric, so it will drop packets that exceed 15 hops. It also employs split horizon
	advertisement which means that a node is prohibited to advertising a route back to the interface from
	which it was learned. It also uses Route poisoning which means that a nodes hop count is set to 16
	indicating that the route is invalid if a invalid route is found. The third method is holddown which means
	that the router starts a timer when it first recieves information about a network that is unreachable.
	Until the timer expires the router will discard any subsequent route messages that indicate the route is in
	fact reachable.	

9-2 What should your RIP router send out in the packets it sends, and to which networks.

	RIP should bundle the packet the client sends out with information that to reach the client, send to the RIP
	router. 
10 The output of show ip rip and show ip rip status, and the current routing table.
